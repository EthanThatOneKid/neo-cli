## Changes in the Browser Extension Environment üé®

The command-line interface version of the Neo language relies on a page object supplied by [Playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/blob/master/docs/api.md). The Neo language utilizes some functions given by this object in order to operate the simulated browser page. In order for Neo to run in the browser via a browser extension, this page object must be replicated for usage within the browser. In the Neo Companion extension, there must be a page object that contains all of the functions that are used by Neo from Playwright's page object.

## Developer's Note ‚úè

I really like Neopets, but sometimes, I am short on time and I am unable to do all my dailies manually. I created this language so I could script out all of my Neopets dailies and also because I thought it would be a fun project since I enjoy recreational programming.

Edit 1/18/20: During the development of this project, Neopets started using a security feature that makes Puppeteer/Playwright interaction entirely impossible. Because of this, instead of making this language exclusively for Neopets scripting, I decided to make it an all-purpose web-scripting language.

Edit 4/28/20: I have completed the modern version of the Neo language complete with API docs and all. Let the automation begin!
